Potato Disease Classification 
Potato leaf disease detection is an essential task in agriculture to ensure the health and yield of potato crops. This project aims to develop a machine learning model using TensorFlow to automatically detect diseases in potato leaves based on images.
dataset: The dataset used for training the model consists of images of potato leaves with different diseases. The dataset can be obtained from ['https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village']. It is organized into categories based on the type of disease present in the leaves.
Requirements:
     matplotlib
     numpy
     notebook
     tensorflow-addons
     tensorflow-model-optimization
     tensorflow==2.5
Model Architecture:
The model architecture used for potato leaf disease detection is a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow's Keras API. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers for classification. The final layer uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.
Training:
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets using a function get_dataset_partitions_tf. The model is trained using the training set, and the performance is evaluated using the validation set. Hyperparameters such as batch size, image size, and number of epochs can be adjusted for optimal performance.
Evaluation:
The trained model's performance is evaluated using the test set to assess its accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally, confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics can be computed to analyze the model's performance for each class.
Results:
The results of the potato leaf disease detection model, including accuracy, loss curves, and classification metrics, will be documented and analyzed.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model for potato leaf disease detection using TensorFlow. Further improvements and optimizations can be made to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency.
